The Telnyx WebRTC SDK provides all the functionality you need to start making voice calls from a browser to phone numbers or other browsers.

## Requirements

You'll need node v11.15.0 or later.

You'll also need a Telnyx account in order to authenticate your application. Follow our [quick start guide](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/sip-trunking/quickstarts/portal-setup) to create a **Connection** with **Credentials Authentication** -- it's simple and quick to get set up with secure credentials that are automatically generated for you.

## Our packages

- `@telnyx/webrtc`
- `@telnyx/react-native` - [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@telnyx/react-native)

## Installation

Install the package with:

```
npm install @telnyx/webrtc --save
```

As long as you can import npm packages with a bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), you're ready to import `TelnyxRTC` and begin:

```js
import { TelnyxRTC } from '@telnyx/webrtc';
```

## Usage

To initialize the JavaScript SDK, you'll need to authenticate using a Telnyx Connection. You can access the Connection credentials in the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/connections).

```js
// Initialize the client
const client = new TelnyxRTC({
  // Required credentials
  login: username,
  password: password,
  // Other options
  // This file can be a wav/mp3 in your local public folder or you can host it in a CDN and pass just the URL, such as https://cdn.company.com/sounds/call.mp3
  ringFile: './sounds/incoming_call.mp3',
});

// Create a variable to track the current call
let activeCall;

// Attach event listeners
client
  .on('telnyx.socket.open', () => console.log('socket open'))
  .on('telnyx.socket.close', () => {
    console.log('socket closed');
    client.disconnect();
  })
  .on('telnyx.socket.error', (error) => {
    console.log('telnyx.socket.error', error);
    client.disconnect();
  })
  .on('telnyx.ready', () => console.log('ready to call'))
  .on('telnyx.error', () => console.log('error'))
  // Event fired on call updates, e.g. when there's an incoming call
  .on('telnyx.notification', (notification) => {
    activeCall = notification.call;

    switch (notification.type) {
      case 'callUpdate':
        // Call is over and can be removed
        if (
          notification.call.state === 'hangup' ||
          notification.call.state === 'destroy'
        ) {
          activeCall = null;
        }
        // An established and active call
        if (notification.call.state === 'active') {
          return;
        }
        // New calls that haven't started connecting yet
        if (notification.call.state === 'new') {
          return;
        }
        // Receiving an inbound call
        if (notification.call.state === 'ringing') {
          return;
        }
        // Call is active but on hold
        if (notification.call.state === 'held') {
          return;
        }
        break;
    }
  });

// Connect and login
client.connect();

// You can disconnect when you're done
// client.disconnect();
```

Important: You should treat Connection credentials as sensitive data and should not hardcode credentials into your frontend web application. Check out the [examples](https://github.com/team-telnyx/webrtc/tree/master/examples/react) for sample React code that handles username and password by prompting the user.

### Calls

To initiate a call from your application:

```js
// You can save this call or wait for `callUpdate` and use the returned `activeCall`
const call = client.newCall({
  // Destination is required and can be a phone number or SIP URI
  destinationNumber: '18004377950',
  callerName: 'Caller ID Name',
  // Caller ID number is optional.
  // You can only specify a phone number that you own and have assigned
  // to your Connection in the Telnyx Portal
  callerNumber: 'â€¬',
  audio: true,
  video: false, //Used to enable/disable video
});
```

A [Call](./docs/ts/interfaces/icall.md) has methods that can be hooked up to your UI:

```js
// End a call
call.hangup();

// Call states that can be toggled
call.hold();
call.unhold();
call.mute();
call.unmute();

// Send digits and keypresses
call.dtmf('1234');

// Transfer the call to another destination
call.transfer('destination');

// Answer an incoming call
call.answer();
// Reject an incoming call
call.reject();
```

#### Using WebRTC with React to make an audio call

```Js
    // Used to set remote stream
    if (mediaRef.current && call && call.remoteStream) {
        mediaRef.current.srcObject = call.remoteStream;
    }

    <audio
      ref={mediaRef}
      id='audioCall'
      autoPlay='autoplay'
      controls={false}
    />
```

#### Using WebRTC with Vanilla Javascript to make video call

```Js
    // Used to set local and remote stream
    client.remoteElement = 'remoteVideo';
    client.localElement = 'localVideo';

    <video
      id="localVideo"
      autoplay="true"
      playsinline="true"
    />
     <video
      id="remoteVideo"
      autoplay="true"
      playsinline="true"
    />

```

## Commit message style

This package depends on Conventional Commits in order to semantically version each release. The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

For example:

```
fix: Return correct device list in Firefox
```

```
feat: Switch default codec

BREAKING CHANGE
```

Refer to the [Conventional Commits guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for the full specification.
